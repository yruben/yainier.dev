import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';

// ... other imports ... assume a BlogPostLayout or similar rendered here.
// Since I don't see a layout, I'll assume rendering inline or finding a layout.
// Checking "layouts" var in list_dir might reveal 'BlogPostLayout.astro'.
// Actually, I'll just look at what's available.
// For now, I'll just create the file to fetch the entry.
