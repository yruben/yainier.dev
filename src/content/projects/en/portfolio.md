# Personal Portfolio

This is the very portfolio website you are exploring right now. It is designed to be a fast, accessible, and visually striking showcase of my skills and projects.

**Key Features:**
*   **High Performance:** Built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) for zero-JavaScript-by-default architecture, ensuring lightning-fast load times.
*   **Modern UI/UX:** Styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) using a dark-themed, neon-inspired aesthetic ("Cyberpunk/Futuristic" vibe).
*   **Interactive Components:** Leveraging **React** for dynamic UI elements like the hero typewriter effect, project cards, and animations (powered by Framer Motion).
*   **Internationalization (i18n):** Full support for English and Spanish content.
*   **Dark Mode:** Built-in theme toggling for user preference.
*   **Responsive Design:** Fully fluid layout that looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
