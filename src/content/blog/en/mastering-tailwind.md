# Mastering Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build custom designs without ever leaving your HTML.

## Key Concepts

- **Utility Classes**: Single-purpose classes like `flex`, `pt-4`, `text-center`.
- **Responsive Design**: Prefix utilities with breakpoints like `md:flex`.
- **Customization**: Configure your theme in `tailwind.config.mjs`.
