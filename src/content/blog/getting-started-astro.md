# Getting Started with Astro

Astro is a new kind of static site builder for the modern web. It delivers lightning-fast performance with a modern developer experience.

## Why Astro?

1. **Zero JS by default**: Astro renders HTML on the server and strips away any remaining JavaScript.
2. **Collections**: Manage your content with type safety.
3. **Integrations**: Use your favorite tools like Tailwind, React, Vue, etc.
