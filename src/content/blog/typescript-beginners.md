# TypeScript for Beginners

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. It helps catch errors early and improves code maintainability.

## Benefits

- **Type Safety**: Catch type-related bugs at compile time.
- **IntelliSense**: Better code completion and navigation in your IDE.
- **Modern Features**: Use the latest ECMAScript features.
