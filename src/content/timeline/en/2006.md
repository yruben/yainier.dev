fullDescription: "The Informatic Sciences University in Havana was the starting point. I wrote my first line of code in C#. It was a simple HELLO WORLD, but it ignited a lifelong passion. I began learning to program, programming logic, and discrete mathematics. I participated in programming competitions and started connecting with other truly brilliant students in this field who were deeply interested in professional growth."
